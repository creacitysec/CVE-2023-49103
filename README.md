# CVE-2023-49103
PoC for the CVE-2023-49103

## Overview
This Python script is designed to efficiently process a large list of URLs to check for the presence of `phpinfo()` output. It uses multi-threading to handle a large number of URLs concurrently, significantly speeding up the process. The script also features a real-time progress bar to visually track the progress.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests`
- `urllib3`
- `colorama`
- `alive-progress`
- `concurrent.futures` (part of the standard library in Python 3)

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the script.
3. Install the required Python packages:

        pip install requests urllib3 colorama alive-progress
## Usage
To use the script, you need a text file containing a list of URLs to check. Each URL should be on a new line.

Prepare your URL list: Create a text file (e.g., urls.txt) with each URL on a new line.

Run the script: Use the script with the following command, replacing input_file.txt with your file of URLs and output_file.txt with the desired output file name:

    
    python exploit.py -t input_file.txt -o output_file.txt
View Results: The script will process each URL and output the results to the specified output file. URLs with valid phpinfo() output are logged in this file.
